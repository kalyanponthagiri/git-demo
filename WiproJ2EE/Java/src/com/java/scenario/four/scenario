A company wants to develop an Employee Task Management System to efficiently manage employee tasks. 
The system should allow:

Storing Employee Information (ID, Name, Department).

Assigning Tasks to employees with details like Task ID, Description, Priority, and Status.

Retrieving Tasks based on priority, employee name, or department.

Removing Completed Tasks from the system.

Tracking Pending Tasks assigned to employees.

Collections to be Used:

HashMap<Integer, Employee> → To store employees with their employee ID as the key.

HashMap<Integer, List<Task>> → To store tasks assigned to each employee.

PriorityQueue<Task> → To retrieve tasks based on priority.

LinkedList<Task> → To maintain a list of pending tasks.
